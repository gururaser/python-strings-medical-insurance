# Python Strings: Medical Insurance Project
 This is one of the projects from Codecademy's Data Science Foundation Skill Path (This Skill Path also exists in Data Science Career Paths).
 
 I uploaded this because this project taught me basics of 'Cleaning Data' and 'Analyzing Data' and it made me feel like I am doing something real.
